The README.md file inside the folder contains more information on the scripts in that folder.

## ROS2 Package

### Build
```bash
mkdir -p ~/utils_ros2_ws/src 
cd ~/utils_ros2_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/Alexander-guo/utils_ros2.git
cd ..
colcon build --packages-select utils_ros2 --symlink-install
source ~/utils_ros2_ws/install/setup.bash # Or add this to ~/.bashrc to make it permanent
```

### Usage 

#### Extract Keyframes
To extract keyframes from a ros2bag, run the following command:
```bash
ros2 launch utils_ros2 write_keyframe_images.xml bag_file:=bag_file image_dir:=dir_to_save_images traj_file:=VIO_trajectory_file.txt config_file:=camera_config_file.yaml num_extra:=number_extra_frame
```

Note: By default, the keyframes are undistorted. The reason being COLMAP undistortion changes image size in an effort to maximize information from images.

The gopro config files are inside the ```config/gopro``` folder. 

Check the launch file for additional parameters.
